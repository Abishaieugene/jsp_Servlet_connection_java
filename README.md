Hey viewers!
here is my update!

Description of the Project:
The login form is implemented using JSP and servlets to authenticate users with a MySQL database.
When a username and password are entered, the system verifies the credentials stored in the database. 
If the credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed: "Invalid credentials, please try again." If the credentials are correct, a success message is shown: "Login successful."
